              You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that
              <br>we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on investment. Our
              <br>goal is to give you as much infomation as possible to make this determination one
              <br>way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for
              <br>you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current customers to talk
              <br>about their experience.

            <p class="one-half-space font-15">
              Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community
              <br>resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling your
              <br>payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll
              <br>also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that
              <br>sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health
              <br>information exchanges or other information technology vendors are important, we
              <br>will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.

            <p class="one-half-space font-15">
              The first thing we will do is gain acccess to a full backup of your current data, Which
              <br>we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR
              <br>databases. Then out work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and
              <br> information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward.
              <br>While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has
              <br>been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.

            <p class="one-half-space font-15">
              We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content,
              <br>charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks
              <br>prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice
              <br>management, and billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, on of our
              <br>team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on implementation and
              <br>training.

            <p class="one-half-space font-15">
              Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be
              <br>with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure
              <br>everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a
              <br>handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical microtemplates,
              <br>setting up new automations, modifying practice management setting, and more.
              <br>We are here to help with it all.

              All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide
              <br>support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not
              <br>meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all payments
              <br>back. (We do not expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a
              <br>MIPS guaranteed: if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for
              <br>everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a
              <br>long, productive partnership for us both.
